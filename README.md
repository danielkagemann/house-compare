# Villaya

This is a private project to collect favorite real estates to be able to compare them. You can add as many real estates you want and also
entering the data is done half-automatic or completely manually.

Because websites do not like webcrawling, there is a half-automatic import for idealista and thinkspain links by using pasted HTML source. I tried different things for crawling but
captcha hits hard and could not get it done in less effort (tried puppeteer, playwright, proxy, ...).

## ideas for future implementations

-  ~~map via toggle on main listing page instead of separate page~~
-  ~~more colorful tilelayer~~
-  ~~comparison does not look good on mobile~~ better but not perfect
-  ~~details with indicator which field has empty data~~
-  topscore with more checks (year should be removed)
-  ~~personal ranking as new field (db + details)~~
-  add translation of description possibility
-  ~~show map on compare~~

## finding a domain name

This was harder than expected. I asked chatGPT a lot and also used services like namelix.com. The results were awesome but nothing really kicked.
So I used namelix.com examples and threw them into chatgpt to match them against my requirements.
Here are the top 3 results.
