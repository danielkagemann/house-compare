# house-compare

This is a small project to compare different houses (from idealista) and show them enxt to each other.
Sorting can be changed by dropdown.

Because websites do not like webcrawling, I decided to add new data by using pasted HTML source. I tried different things for crawling but
captcha hits hard and could not get it done in less effort (tried puppeteer, playwright).

## Some insights

## dependencies used

- nextjs for client ~~and server~~
- tailwind css
- ~~cheerio (server api parses the HTML here)~~ replaced with DOM parsing to be deployable on GH pages
